        <div class="paragraph-padding gap">
          <p class="paragraph">I’m currently a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook University. 
            I was born and raised in Queens, New York and love spending time with family and friends, traveling, and 
            baking in my free time. Ever since I was a kid, I was amazed by how technology can be used to help <i>anyone</i> of <i>any</i> field. 
            Helping others is always a large virtue of mine and I envisioned 
            computer science as the perfect way to find creative and innovative solutions for everyone.

      <h1 class="section-header">Going out of your comfort zone can do a lot.</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-padding gap">
        <p class="paragraph bottom-padding">In high school, my main motivation was to obtain good grades - it seemed to be the only factor 
          that proved myself in front of others. However, the freedom that college life introduced to me proved me wrong. 
          <i>What do you want to do in the future?</i> That was the one question that slammed everyone in the face on day one. For the 
          first time, I couldn’t say that good grades were my future. Granted, good grades were good for the future, but for what 
          future once I finish college? As I saw others with ambitions and dreams at school, I recognized that I wanted to find my 
          own ambition - as silly as it sounds, I wanted to discover who I was and find dreams to chase like them, and the only way to do that
          is by jumping out of my comfort zone. And during the process, failing is okay. I failed club interviews, quit being a lab assistant, and loved giving technical support at my on-campus job. 
          I learned that I needed to improve on communicating and learned what I was and was not interested in. There's so much to learn, but I'm glad
          that I am starting this journey of self-discovery now rather than never.

      <h2 class="section-caption top">USABILITY</h2>
      <h1 class="section-header">Technology shouldn't be hard to use for anyone.</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-padding gap">
        <p class="paragraph">As I learned new programs and performed tech support on the job or for my parents, something 
          became very apparent: as far as technology has advanced, it is sometimes still hard to use. Sometimes, it baffles me 
          that programs were made without the user in mind. Many of us tend to get ahead of ourselves by seeing the innovation 
          that our program can bring, but that innovation cannot be used if the users themselves cannot figure out how to use it. 
          Technology comes with a large learning curve for many users, which is usually caused by poor user interfaces, planning, 
          and execution. Thus, I’ve been heavily invested in human-computer interaction and web/app development, making my goal to 
          create simple, fluid, and personal experiences to help anyone of any industry. We shouldn't have to sacrifice usability with innovation.
           By combining these ideals with innovation, we can create an immersive canvas and build more with our clients, <b><i>together</i></b>.

      <h1 class="section-header">Family and friends make me so happy everyday.</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-padding gap">
        <p class="paragraph">It took me a while to figure this out, but balancing my work and social life is so important to 
          fueling a healthy mindset and being happy. During my free time, I love spending time with family and friends as we go 
          shopping, try new restaurants, and explore new places. I am lucky to have a family and cousins who I love as we support 
          each other with our life goals. My sister, Rachel, is my best friend in life and I also couldn’t be who I am today without 
          her on my side. We’ve all been to the Bahamas, South Korea, and most recently Canada! My family and friends make me so happy 
          and I’m thankful to them everyday for being with me to create memories I will never forget - they make up who I am today.
